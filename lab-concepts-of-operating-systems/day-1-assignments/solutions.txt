                          UNIX Assignments : Day 1

Notes :
1. UNIX is derived from UNICS which stands for Uniplexed Information Computing System.
2. The Linux Documentation Project : Documentation of Linux

                                 Section 1

Que 1. List all the files and sub directories of the directory /bin.
Ans 1. ls /bin
       - /bin contains all the executable files that could be run by every user.
       - /sbin contains all the system executable files that could only be run by system admin.

Que 2. List all the files including hidden files in your current directory.
Ans 2. ls -a
       - here a stands for all including hidden files.

Que 3. List all the files starting with letter ‘r’ in your current directory.
Ans 3. ls -p r* | grep -v /
       - lists all the files starting with letter r.
       - p is for adding / to the directories.
       - grep is to finding the matching /
       - v is for inverting the matching /, hence it will ignore all the directories.

Que 4. List all the files having three characters in their names, from your current directory.
Ans 4. ls ???
       - ? matches exactly one character.

Que 5. List all the files with extension .doc in your current directory.
Ans 5. ls *.doc
       - files with only doc extension not docx.

Que 6. List all the files having the first letter of their name within the range ‘l’ to‘s’, from your current directory.
Ans 6. ls [l-s]*
       - [] are used to define the range of characters that can be used.

Que 7. Create a file "Day 1 Text 1" and read its input from keyboard.
Ans 7. cat > "Day 1 Text 1"
       - Use Ctrl + D to end the input.
       - This is called redirection to input.

Que 8. Copy the contents of file "Day 1 Text 1" to another file "Day 1 Text 2".
Ans 8. cp -i "Day 1 Text 1" "Day 1 Text 2"
       - Overwrites the file if i is not specified and file already exists.
       - i flag is for interactivity if file already exists.

Que 9. Append the contents of file "Day 1 Text 2" to file "Day 1 Text 1".
Ans 9. cat "Day 1 Text 2" >> "Day 1 Text 1"
       - For appending we use >> operator.

Que 10. Count the number of files in the current directory.
Ans 10. ls | wc -l
        - wc is used to print newline, word and byte count for each file.
        - l is used to only print line numbers.

Que 11. Display the output of command ls –l to a file and on the output screen.
Ans 11. ls -l | tee "Day 1 Text 3"
    - tee reads from standard input and write to standard output and files.

Que 12. From file "Day 1 Text 1" print all lines starting from 10th line.
Ans 12. mawk 'NR >= 10 { print }' "Day 1 Text 1"
        - mawk is a pattern scanning and text processing language.
        - Short programs are entered on the command line usually enclosed in ' '.
        - NR is a built-in variable that holds the number of records.

        sed -n '10,$'p "Day 1 Text 1"
        - sed is a stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
        - n is used to suppress automatic printing of pattern space.
        - p is used to print the current pattern space.
        - $ represents the last line.
        - 'start, end' or 'start ~ increment'
        - Patterns are written inside / /;

Que 13. Find the number of users currently logged on to the system.
Ans 13. w
        - show who is logged on and what they are doing.

        who
        - show who is logged on

        users
        - show only usernames of the logged in 

Que 14. Delete all the files with their names starting with “temp”.
Ans 14. rm -i temp*
        - rm removes files or directories.
        - i flag is used for interactivity or adding prompts.
        - shred is also a command to delete files after overwriting its content.

                                     Section 2

Que 1. Count the total number of words in file "Day 1 Text 1".
Ans 1. wc -w 'Day 1 Text 1'
       cat 'Day 1 Text 1' | wc -w
       - first command prints word count and file name.
       - second command prints only the word count.

Que 2. List the contents of ls command page wise.
Ans 2. ls | less
       - less displays the content in page wise format.

Que 3. Create a file "Day 1 Text 2" with some text in it. Increase the no. of hard links to the file "Day 1 Text 2" to 3 and check the inode number and link count for those names.
Ans 3. cat > "Day 1 Text 2"
       ln "Day 1 Text 2" "Day 1 Text 2 Hard Link 1"
       ln "Day 1 Text 2" "Day 1 Text 2 Hard Link 2"
       ln "Day 1 Text 2" "Day 1 Text 2 Hard Link 3"
       ls -li
       find -type f -links +1
       - cat command is used to take input into the file.
       - ln command is used to make links between files.
       - By default, ln makes hard links which means inode numbers of original file and hard links are same.
       - To make a soft link we have to specify s flag in the command.
       - Soft links have different inode number than original file.
       - i flag in ls command is used to display the inode of a file.
       - find command is used to search for files in a directory hierarchy.
       - type flag is used to define the type of file.
       - f specifies a regular file.
       - links specifies the hard link and +1 is used for greater than 1.
