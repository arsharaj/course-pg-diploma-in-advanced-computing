1. Thank you Sir, for giving me this opportunity. My name is Arsharaj Chauhan. I am 23 years old and I was born in Dholpur Rajasthan and did my high schooling from there. There after, I pursued Computer Science as my career stream and graduated from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University, Uttar Pradesh with flying colors. Even after graduating I was not feeling confident with my technical skills and that's why I enrolled into Cdac to strengthen my technical and non technical skills. I am proficient in various technologies both front-end as well as back-end particularly Flutter (which is a cross platform application development platform), Spring Framework. I am well versed with Dot Net Core, Git and Github. Also I keep on updating myself. My strongest interpersonal skill is to persevere through things even in the hardest of times and never give up. I am adaptable to team work and I have been a project leader in KEC Hackathon where my team was runner up. My hobbies include participating in various online coding contest over sites like codingames where I can interact with other fellow coders and I have also done open source contributions in my free time.
