Revise Multi threading (Thread state transitions n Threads API)
Apply threads to Collections n I/O
Synchronization
Thread un safe collections
Inter Thread communication(if time permits !)


Important Questions

1. What will happen if you don't implement run() method in implements scenario
javac err
2. What will happen if you don't override run() method in extends scenario
no err , ineffective(do nothing!) thread will be created --strted --dead!
3. What will happen if you invoke run() method instead of start ?
no err , BUT exec logic of the thread will be called by main thread(i.e single threaded app , no concurrency!!!!)

4. What will happen if you call start() on a runnable thread?
Run time err : invoker thrd will get : IllegalThreadStateExc 
5. What will happen if you call start() on a dead thread?
Run time err : invoker thrd will get : IllegalThreadStateExc 

6. Name the un blocking triggers for a thread blocked on sleep?
sleep duration over | interrupt
7. Name the un blocking triggers for a thread blocked on read (using java.io)?
Data being available
8. What will happen if another thread sends interrupt to a thread blocked on read (using java.io)?
Thread blocked on i/o : stays blocked!

9. Name the un blocking triggers for a thread blocked on join?
eg : t1 n t2
In t1' s run()
t2.join(10000);
Un blocking triggers : t2 over |  interrupt | tm out



----------------------Revision over ----------------------------


1. Apply threads to Collections n I/O
(Refer : whiteboard1)





2. Refer to join account scenario , complete it n test !
refer : whiteboard2

Write a multi threaded application to share a joint account among multiple bank customers . 
Services : update balance
check balance
Ensure no orphans .
Refer to synchronization readme


eg code for getting random no
Random r1=new Random();
int nextRandomInt=r1.nextInt();


More examples(practice1 n practice2 code)
