Develop RESTful services for managing appointments in a healthcare system. Users should be able to schedule
appointments, view their upcoming appointments and cancel appointments.

Endpoints:
1. Create appointment:
	- Endpoint: POST /appointments
	- Request: Schedule a new appointment by providing details like paitent name, doctor, date and time.
	- Response: Return the confirmation of the schedules appointment.
2. Get upcoming appointments:
	- Endpoint: GET /appointments/{userId}/upcoming
	- Request: Retrive a list of upcoming appointments for a specific user.
	- Response: Return the details of upcoming appointments in JSON format.
3. Cancel appointment:
	- Endpoint: DELETE /appointments/{appointmentId}
	- Request: Cancel a schedules appointment by providing its unique identifier
	- Response: Return a success message or confirmation of the canceled appointment

Note:
- Response codes should by as per REST guidelines.
- Error handling in case of failures.
- There should not be conflicting appointments, for example - more than one appointment with same doctor on same date and time.
- You can create only one table appointments. Creating seperate tables for user/doctor is completely optional.
