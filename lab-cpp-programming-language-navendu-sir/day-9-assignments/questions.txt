Assignment: 

1. Finish the implementation of BigInt class by overloading remaining relational operators to compare two BigInt objects.
   Also write a small program to demonstrate the use of BigInt class and overloaded relational operators.

2. Implement a Date class with following member functions. Also overload remaining relational operators to compare two dates.
   Also write a small program to demonstrate the use of Date class and overloaded relational operators.
class Date {
	int day;
	int month;
	int year;
public:
	Date();
	Date(int d, int m, int y);
	void Read();
	void Write();
	bool operator==(Date obj2);
};

3. Design (define what all constructors, member functions and operator functions to overload relational operators) and implement them.
   Also write a small program to demonstrate the use of String class and overloaded relational operators.
