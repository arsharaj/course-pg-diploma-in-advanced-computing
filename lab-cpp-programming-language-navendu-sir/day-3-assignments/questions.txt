Exercise:
For following. write algorithm/flow chart/pseudo code for following problems.
Test their correctness by doing dry run with given sample inputs.

Assignment:
Implement them as Cpp program.


1. Given a positive integer N, find all factors of N.
For example:
N = 12
Factors = 1 2 3 4 6 12
N = 5
Factors = 1 5


2. Given a positive integer N, find its reverse.
For example:
N = 534
Reverse = 435
N = 5
Reverse = 5


3. Find sum of all numbers between two positive integers N and M, including N and M.
For example:
N = 3
M = 7
Sum = 25 (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7)


4. Find prime numbers between two positive integers N and M, including N and M.
For example:
N = 3
M = 10
Prime Numbers = 3 5 7


5. Find the first digit in a positive integer.
For example:
Number = 32
First Digit = 3


6. Find the sum of all digit of a positive integer.
For example:
Number = 3245
Sum of digits = 14 (3 + 2 + 4 + 5)


7. Find the sum of all digit of a integer (both positive and negative).
For example:
Number = -3245
Sum of digits = 14 (3 + 2 + 4 + 5)
Number = 12
Sum of digits = 3 (1 + 2)


8. Find the product of all digit of a positive integer.
For example:
Number = 312
Sum of digits = 6 (3 x 1 x 2)


9. Given a positive integer N, check if its palindrome or not. A palindrome number is a number that is same as its reverse.
For example:
Number = 32
Not a palindrome. (Reverse is 23 and not same as 32)
Number = 545
A palindrome. (Reverse is 545 and not same as 545)


10. Given a positive integer N, check if it is a perfect number or not.
Perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its factors (excluding the number itself).
For example:
N = 12
Factors = 1 2 3 4 6 (we do not consider 12)
Sum of factors = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16
As Sum of factors is not equal to the Number 12, 12 is not a perfect number.
N = 6
Factors = 1 2 3 (we do not consider 6)
Sum of factors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
As Sum of factors is equal to the Number 6, 6 is a perfect number.


11. Given a positive integer N, check if it is an armstrong number or not.
An armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
For example:
N = 153
Number of digits in number = 3
Sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits = (1 x 1 x 1) + (5 x 5 x 5) + (3 x 3 x 3) = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
153 is armstrong number.

N = 15
Number of digits in number = 2
Sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits = (1 x 1) + (5 x 5) = 1 + 25 = 26
15 is not an armstrong number.


12. Find the count of a digit in a given positive integer.
For example:
Number = 12123
Digit = 1
Count of digit 1 in 12123 = 2 (as 1 appears twice in the number)


13. Given a positive integer N, print the digits in the number as words.
For example:
N = 231
Result = Two Three One


14. Given a positive integer N, print the number in words.
For example:
N = 5312
Result = Five Thousand Three Hundred Twelve
